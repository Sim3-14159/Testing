#### This is some example Arduino code
```c++
#include <Arduino.h>

// This code should turn the built-in LED on and off.

void setup()
{
    pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop()
{
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
    delay(1000);
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
    delay(100);
}
```
